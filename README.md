### ðŸ‘‹ Hello there, I'm Ahmet Vepayev

I have been trying coding on and off for my entire life and recently started seriously pursuing a carrer in software development

I'm currently learning C#, Java, Python and JavaScript

My main focus is C# and related back-end technologies such as .NET and .NET Framework

If you are also a student of the ways of the back-end and are interested in collaborating on small scale projects, hit me up through [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmetvepayev/) or ahmetwepaogly@gmail.com
